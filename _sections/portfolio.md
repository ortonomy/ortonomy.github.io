**Boosting organizational memory and resource planning:** Working with freelancers means an inevitable level of flux in availability of quality talent. Teams with even a modest number of freelancer relationships find this data difficult to manage. So I started an open source project **fling.work**, the first 'freelancer relationship management' system.

**Open source & collaborative:** I have opened sourced the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/ortonomy/flingapp-frontend){: target="blank"}. It's developed with one full-time collaborator and several other freelancer developers and tech enthusiasts from a Shanghai local coding collective and freelancer organization called [Coderbunker](https://coderbunker.com/){: target="blank"}.

**Fixing the oldest problem:** In digital education, the biggest barrier to learning is the lack of opportunity to practice and test speaking. We fixed that for mobile users, by creating a new decision-based speaking activity with asynchronous teacher grading and feedback.

Students are asked to spontaneoulsy produce language they've been learning and teachers listen to the submitted audios giving grades and specific feedback on their errors and areas for improvement.

**Centre of innovation:** as a product designer I was also part of a cross-functional team which innovated to breath life into the practice and examination of reading and writing on our iOS and Android apps. We achieved some elegant solutions using the affordances of touch devices.

We wanted students to have a comfortable experience scrolling through a reading text, allowing a scrollable text area closer their thumbs. For the writing experience, we wanted to minimise the number of words actually typed by students, given the combined effect of low fluency and low observed words per minute speeds with mobile text input.

**Creativity and code:** Here is a select of software development projects built for [Free Code Camp](https://freecodecamp.com/){: target="blank"} and for my own learning and investigation into what can be done with CSS and Javascript:
