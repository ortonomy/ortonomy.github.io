**Boosting organizational memory and resource planning:** Working with freelancers means an inevitable level of flux in availability of quality talent. Teams with even a modest number of freelancer relationships find this data difficult to manage. To solve this, I started **fling.work**, the first 'freelancer relationship management' system.

**Open-source & collaborative:** I have open-sourced the app on [GitHub](https://github.com/ortonomy/flingapp-frontend){: target="blank"}. It's developed with one full-time collaborator and several other freelance developers and tech enthusiasts from a Shanghai-local coding collective called [Coderbunker](https://coderbunker.com/){: target="blank"}.

**Fixing the oldest problem:** In digital language instruction, the biggest barrier to learning is the lack of opportunity to practice and test speaking. We fixed that for mobile users, by creating a new decision-based speaking activity with asynchronous teacher grading and feedback.

Students are asked to spontaneously produce language they've been learning and teachers listen to the production giving grades and specific feedback on their errors and areas for improvement.

**Centre of innovation:** as a product designer and part of a cross-functional team, we innovated to bring practice and examination of reading and writing onto the mobile platform. A real challenge given the affordance and constraints of mobile devices.
